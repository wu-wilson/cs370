As an athletic emory student,
I want to see if court space is available,
so that I can go spontaneously with my friends.

As a person using a court,
I want to scan a QR code to show that the court is taken,
so that other people do not walk in on me.

As a person finishing up my court exercise,
I want to scan a QR code at the end of my session
to indicate that the court space is now free.
